Fake love, fake love, fake love
I need the real one, please let me feel something, oh Lord no
Fake love, fake love, fake love
At least while we're still young, let's try to feel something
Oh Lord no

Fake it with you, I don't wanna fake it with you
Don't wanna fake it with you, I don't wanna fake it with you, no no
Fake it with you, I don't wanna fake it with you
Don't wanna fake it with you, I don't wanna fake it with you, no no

Something bout the feeling just ain't right
When I'm with her I think of you each night
I'll swallow my pride and book that flight
I'll reach out to feel you, girl I need the real you, I can't lie

My wish, is to play beside you
Like this, pleasure I provide you
If I could, I would give the sky to you
I dedicate my life to you, girl
Hopeless, I'm lost here without you
[?] meant to, just what I do
Hey I'm, with her, she's not like you
She's not like you
It's just

Fake love, fake love, fake love
I need the real one, please let me feel something, oh Lord no
Turn the lights on
Fake love, fake love, fake love
At least while we're still young, let's try to feel something
Oh Lord no

Fake it with you, I don't wanna fake it with you
Don't wanna fake it with you, I don't wanna fake it with you, no no
Fake it with you, I don't wanna fake it with you
Don't wanna fake it with you, I don't wanna fake it with you, no no
